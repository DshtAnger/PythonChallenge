>Python Challenge is a game in which each level can be solved by a bit of (Python) programming.  
>Python Challenge welcomes programmers of all languages. You will be able to solve most riddles in any programming language, but some of them will require Python.  
>Sometimes you'll need extra modules. All can be downloaded for free from the internet.  
>It is just for fun - nothing waits for you at the end.  
>Keep the scripts you write - they might become useful.
